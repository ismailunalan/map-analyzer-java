# 🛣️ Map Analyzer - Java 🚀  

A **Java-based road network analyzer** that calculates the **fastest routes**, optimizes **road connectivity**, and compares **construction costs** using graph algorithms like **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**.

This project demonstrates **Graph Theory, Algorithm Design, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Java Collections.**

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Finds the shortest route** → Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to determine the fastest path between two points  
✅ **Constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** → Rebuilds the road network with minimum cost  
✅ **Analyzes construction material efficiency** → Compares the cost of the original vs. optimized road network  
✅ **Handles error cases** → Detects invalid input formats and handles missing routes gracefully  
✅ **Object-Oriented Design (OOP)** → Implements encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
